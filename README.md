# ThreatCap
Python tool to analyze suspicious PCAP

This tool is a personal project to practice using LLM's. ThreatCap is wrote in Python and will be interacted with through the command line.

How this tool is intended to work:
	Command line input
	Program ingests and analyzes the data.
	Compares the data against the LLM which is trained on malicious PCAPS in malwaretrafficanalysis.net.
	Provides a report of what malware/attack may be observed and why.
